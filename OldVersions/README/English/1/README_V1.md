An email revolution; the long awaited update for EMAIL

***

## Features

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the Features section</b></p></summary>

### Email stamps

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the Email stamps section</b></p></summary>

***

#### Flags

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the Email stamps flags section</b></p></summary>

**Flags and values:**

- TO
- FROM
- DATE
- TIME
- ADDRESS[`1` , `99999`] (up to 99999 recipients)
- IS-MAILING-LIST
- MSG-DETAILS
- MSG-HEADERS
- IS-SPAM
- INBOX-TARGET

**Special features:**

- Stamp collection: Users can create a stamp collection

* [View stamp collection](/Stamp-Collection/)

</details>

***

#### Default stamps

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the Default Stamps section</b></p></summary>

Default stamps: `Special stamps will be available as a default, and will be standardized, similar to Emojis`

##### Settings

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the Default Stamps settings section</b></p></summary>

- [ ] Allow default stamps
- - [ ] Custom settings

</details>

</details>

***

#### Custom stamps

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the Custom Stamps section</b></p></summary>

Custom stamps will be allowed, but you may wish to disable them by default if you are an educational institute/someone worried about NSFW/NSFL content, because no matter how good the filters are, this will likely still make it through occasionally.

- [ ] Allow custom stamps
- - [ ] Allow NSFL stamps
- - [ ] Allow NSFW stamps
- - [ ] Allow SFW stamps

> **Note** These settings are in A-Z order. If all 3 settings are turned off, stamps will register as a 256x256 checker texture

- Extra:

> If the user wishes to use Blockchain, it will remain an option, but it won't be a standard. It is essentially a step backwards to have NFT integration into email, but I won't prevent its use entirely. Its support will vary, however, and the following field can be turned off by the user:

- [ ] Allow Blockchain/NFT stamps

If the user has this disabled, a stamp will register as a 256x256 checker texture

![PNGCheckeredTexture.png](/Stamps/Default/PNGCheckeredTexture.png)

Blockchain/NFT stamps will be turned off by default. They are **not recommended**

</details>

#### Stamp commentary

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the Stamp commentary section</b></p></summary>

I was jokingly asked if I was "going for the 80+ crowd" when mentioning stamps, and I was reminded that a lot of people nowadays don't even know what a stamp is. I didn't see very many of them as a child, but I still knew what a stamp was for the majority of my childhood. I am 22 years old.

I like to preserve the past, and my ideas for a set of changes to email to make it more like physical mail went in this theme, as it is inspired heavily by preservation. I would like there to be a higher chance of someone else being able to say they know what a stamp is 22 years from now (in 2045)

## Undesired branding: EMAIL 3.0

<details open><summary><p><b>Click/tap here to expand/collapse the Undesired Email -3.0 branding section</b></p></summary>

### Stamps (Blockchain)

People are likely going to be calling anything Blockchain related 3.0, due to the regrettable Web 3.0 era. I don't want to call it EMAIL 3.0, but this can be an undesirable name, but will never be official.

**My compromise:** Call it EMAIL -3.0 (and you must emphasize the negative)

Idea development during the initial planning of EMAIL 2.0 and EMAIL -3.0

```
Bundle Voicemail with Email (is it really needed?)

- Warning: Keep it a little more simple. We don't want to overtax developers or have an effect where email turns into something bigger, until it evolves into an operating system
- - With that in mind: MailOS

Bundle contacts with Email
Improve Email sending/receiving speeds
Enforce encryption
New encryption keys
Mailman/Mailwoman/Mailperson/MailUnit (we need to keep it gender-neutral, maybe put it up to a preference system?)
Post Office (name of the container of all inboxes)
Defensive features against IDN Homograph attacks
Standards committee (you must also standardize EMAIL 1.0, and EMAIL -3.0, on top of EMAIL 2.0)

Work with:

Further Web 2.0 email capabilities (EG: Decentralized media sharing in a similar fashion to a social media webpage, but not as intrusive, and still fitting the theme of an email)
```

- **Seanpm2001:** Email is basically the gateway to the citadel of the Internet. It is your capital city. If someone is to compromise it, they can quickly compromise everything else. Most websites rely entirely on email verification codes for sign-in, and these always come from either the website itself, or a phone number with an additional verification code. When people come knocking on the door of your Email post office, they are essentially trying to take your capital city. You must fortify and defend your Email as much as possible. - 2023, Tuesday, August 15th

# EMAIL REVOLUTION

EMAIL 2.0 REVOLUTION (Also EMAIL -3.0)

---

Email stamps

Contains: TO, FROM, DATE, TIME, ADDRESS[1,99999] IS-MAILING-LIST, MSG-DETAILS, MSG-HEADERS, IS-SPAM, INBOX-TARGET, KEY
Special features:

~~~

Custom artwork:

No address dependency, but a default stamp image can be set per address
Stamp collection: Users can create a stamp collection

* View stamp collection

~~~

Default stamps: Special stamps will be available as a default, and will be standardized, similar to Emojis

- [ ] Allow default stamps
- - [ ] Custom settings

~~~

Custom stamps: These will be allowed, but you may wish to disable them by default if you are an educational institute/someone worried about NSFW/NSFL content, because no matter how good the filters are, this will likely still make it through occasionally.

- [ ] Allow custom stamps
- - [ ] Allow NSFL stamps
- - [ ] Allow NSFW stamps
- - [ ] Allow SFW stamps

These settings are in A-Z order. If all 3 settings are turned off, stamps will register as a 256x256 checker texture

Extra: If the user wishes to use Blockchain, it will remain an option, but it won't be a standard. It is essentially a step backwards to have NFT integration into email, but I won't prevent its use entirely. Its support will vary, however, and the following field can be turned off by the user:

~~~

- [ ] Allow Blockchain/NFT stamps

If the user has this disabled, a stamp will register as a 256x256 checker texture

~~~

This will be turned off by default

~~~

I was jokingly asked if I was "going for the 80+ crowd" when mentioning stamps, and I was reminded that a lot of people nowadays don't even know what a stamp is. I didn't see very many of them as a child, but I still knew what a stamp was for the majority of my childhood. I am 22 years old.

I like to preserve the past, and my ideas for a set of changes to email to make it more like physical mail went in this theme, as it is inspired heavily by preservation. I would like there to be a higher chance of someone else being able to say they know what a stamp is 22 years from now (in 2045)

Undesired branding: EMAIL 3.0

Stamps (Blockchain)

People are likely going to be calling anything Blockchain related 3.0, due to the regrettable Web 3.0 era. I don't want to call it EMAIL 3.0, but this can be an undesirable name, but will never be official.

Compromise: Call it EMAIL -3.0 (and you must emphasize the negative)
